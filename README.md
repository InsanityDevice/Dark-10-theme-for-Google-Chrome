# Dark-10

*Please note that the Chrome theme has been removed from the Chrome Store for a few months because of a copyright strike from Microsoft. I wasn't able to rebrand it until now because of my busy schedule, but I'm currently in the process of doing it.*

*Sadly, since every single thing, including links, is getting rebranded, this means that everyone who had the scrollbar installed will have to reinstall it and that everyone who had bookmarked this page will get a 404 error. Well, this sucks... (2020-01-24)*

### Description
**This is a dark theme for Google Chrome that tries to blend as seamlessly into the Windows 10 dark theme as possible.**

*This theme was made for Chrome v69 and later.* 

Incognito mode uses a blue title bar to distinguish it from the normal mode. The blue is taken from Microsoft Edge's In-Private watermark.

### Installation
Install the theme from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/windows-10-dark/baebencgofnhbdimnijacljeoegbokeh) or by dragging and dropping the .crx file from the latest [release](https://github.com/InsanityDevice/Windows-10-Dark-theme-for-Google-Chrome/releases) into the Extensions page of your browser (chrome://extensions/). Note that you will receive auto-updates (if there are any in the future) only if you install the theme from the Chrome Web Store. However, earlier versions will still be available here, on the releases page.

### Companion scrollbar

In addition to the theme, there is a customizable scrollbar made to accompany it, available on [UserStyles](https://userstyles.org/styles/166079/windows-10-dark-scrollbar) and [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsanityDevice/Windows-10-Dark-theme-for-Google-Chrome/master/Windows-10-Dark-Scrollbar.user.css). You can install it using the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) app, available on the Chrome Web Store.

### Source code and licence
This theme is fully open-source under the Apache Licence 2.0. Check out the source code on [Github](https://github.com/InsanityDevice/Windows-10-Dark-theme-for-Google-Chrome).

### Limitations
Chrome theme devs currently have no ability to colour the omnibox. As a result, the omnibox will always be white. Additionally, the colour of the area in the centre of the Incognito New Tab page cannot be changed.
