![promo_small](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsanityDevice/Windows-10-Dark-theme-for-Google-Chrome/master/Images/promo_small.png)

**This is a dark theme for Google Chrome that tries to blend as seemlessly into the Windows 10 dark theme as possible.**

*This theme was made for Chrome v69 and later.* 

Incognito mode uses a blue titlebar to distinguish it from normal mode. The blue is taken from Microsof Edge's In-Private watermark.

### Installation
Install the theme from the Chrome Web Store [TO BE PUBLISHED] or by dragging and dropping the .crx file from the latest release [here](https://github.com/InsanityDevice/Windows-10-Dark-theme-for-Google-Chrome/releases).

### Companion scrollbar
In addition to the theme, there is a custom scrollbar made to accompany it, available on [UserStyles](https://userstyles.org/styles/166079/windows-10-dark-scrollbar) and [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InsanityDevice/Windows-10-Dark-theme-for-Google-Chrome/master/Windows-10-Dark-Scrollbar.user.css). You can install it using the [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) app, available on the Chrome Web Store.

### Github
This theme is fully open-source under the Apache License 2.0. Check out the source code on [Github](https://github.com/InsanityDevice/Windows-10-Dark-theme-for-Google-Chrome).

### Limitations
Chrome theme devs currently have no ability to colour the omnibox. As a result, the omnibox will always be white. Additionally, the colour of the area in the centre of the Incognito newtab page cannot be changed.

### Uninstallation
To uninstall this theme, go to Settings, scroll down to the Appearance section, and next to "Themes - Material Incognito Dark Theme", click Reset to Default.
